          I'm a passionate UI/UX and Product Designer dedicated to creating
          meaningful digital experiences that resonate with users and drive
          business success.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mb-6">
          My approach centers on problem-solving and design thinking, ensuring
          every solution is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally
          effective.

          I believe great design is invisible—it simply works. Through creativity,
          empathy, and strategic thinking, I craft experiences that feel natural
          and effortless.
